              <strong>VAR.</strong> <br>
            <p>Variables declared with the "var" keyword are function-scoped or globally-scoped. If a var variable is declared outside a function, it is globally scoped and can be accessed throughout the window. If it is declared within a function, it is function-scoped and can only be accessed within that function. var variables can be re-declared and updated within their scope.</p>
            <strong>LET.</strong> <br>
            <p>Variables declared with the "let" keyword are block-scoped. This means that they are only accessible within the block where they are defined. let variables can be updated but not re-declared within their scope.</p>
            <strong>CONST.</strong> <br>
            <p> Variables declared with the "const" keyword are also block-scoped. However, unlike let variables, const variables cannot be updated or re-declared within their scope. Once a const variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed.</p>

              <strong>NULL.</strong> <br>
            <p>null is used to indicate that a variable should have no value.
                null can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.</p>
            <strong>UNDEFINED.</strong>
            <p>undefined is used as the default value of variables until they’re assigned some other value.
                undefined is the value of function arguments that weren’t provided when the function was called.
                undefined is the value you get when you ask an object for a property it doesn’t have.</p>
